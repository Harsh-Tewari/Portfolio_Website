## Overview

<h4>Link to live website : https://harsh-tewari.github.io/Portfolio_Website/</h4>
<br>
This is my portfolio website that has been built using only HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. This showcases my skills, acheivement and things that I've done so far.
<br>
<p>It was a great experience building the first version of my portfolio website. It was both difficult and adventurous at the same time. On the one hand, It was my first time diving deep into frontend development tools, which caused many doubts and problems, but at the same time, it was a quite fun and pleasing experience solving them on my own.
<br>
I got to learn many new things in HTML, CSS, and Js. Each and every problem taught something or the other and gave immense opportunity of learning. I improved quite a lot on my CSS skills and learnt some new things in Javascript.
